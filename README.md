# Overview

This is a basic task scheduling program. It allows the user to create, edit, and delete tasks. The user can schedule a time to each task, decide if they want an alert for it, and attach a description. They can view all the tasks or just the next one that is coming up. The user can also save their tasks to come back to later.

I wrote this software to learn C#, as it is a language I haven't used before but have an interest in. I chose to do a task scheduling program specifically because I thought would be interesting and have properties that would be useful for future projects, such as utilizing time and reading/writing files.


Below is a demo video of my program

# Development Environment

To write this program I used C# in Visual Studio. I used the System, System.IO, and System.Collections.Generic libraries.



# Useful Websites

I found the Microsoft Learn and the Programming with Mosh channel useful when learning more about C#.

# Future Work

To improve this program in the future. I would like to take it out of console and make a better user interface. I would also like to add more customization for the user in various ways such as how they view, sort, and set the information. I think it could also be improved by changing the process the user takes to be more fluid so it doesn't feel as rigid.
